Welcome to _my lifestyle. _I like science and technology. I start paying attention when I'm exposed to content I'm not familiar with _yet_ and/or I'm currently interested in. This includes but is not limited to: entrepreneurship opportunities, religion, culture, MUSIC, event management, PHOTOGRAPHY, art and literature. 

I never really liked reading, until I started reading things I liked. Current book: The Art of War an Ancient Classic

I'm gonna select a few photos I've shot over the years and share them with ya
